# CPU-Schedule-Algo
Given a list of processes, their CPU burst times, arrival times and priorities, this code can implement  preemptive scheduling algorithms on the processes . For each of the scheduling policies, the code will compute and print the completion Time(CT), Turnaround Time(TAT), and Waiting Time(WT) for each process using C Programming

Input Format for the codes: (sample inputs)
1. Preemptive SJF:
```
Process   Arrival Time   Burst
  p1          0            5
  p2          2            2
  p3          3            4
  p4          4            4
  p5          5            5
```

2. Round Robin:
```
Process      Burst
  p1          53
  p2          17
  p3          68
  p4          24
```

3. Preemptive Priority:
```
Process   Arrival Time   Burst   Priority
  p1          0            15        2
  p2         14             5        4
  p3          3            10        0
  p4          9            22        3
  p5          7            16        1
```
