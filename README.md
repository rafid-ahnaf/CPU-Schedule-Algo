# CPU-Schedule-Algo
Given a list of processes, their CPU burst times, arrival times and priorities, this code can implement  preemptive scheduling algorithms on the processes . For each of the scheduling policies, the code will compute and print the completion Time(CT), Turnaround Time(TAT), and Waiting Time(WT) for each process using C Programming
